# SOCIOECONOMIC AND MOBILITY ANALYSIS OF BARCELONA

<hr>
<br>
<br>

### PROJECT SCOPE

##### On this project I would like to make a deeper analysis of the socioconomic status of Barcelona and the public transportation system (Metro, bus, FGC, Tram...) focusing specially on the differences between the different districts and neighbourhoods from a evolutive perspective

<hr>
<br>
<br>

### DATA SOURCE


##### The main source of the data used on this project has been [Barcelona open data website](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es/). Some of the information has been obtained through Webscrapping from different oficial webpages such us [datosgob.es](https://datos.gob.es/es/) and [idescat](https://www.idescat.cat/). The data related to the transportation system has been obtained from the [TMB API](https://developer.tmb.cat/data)

<hr>
<br>
<br>

### HYPOTHESIS

##### Before starting the project, I designed a series of hypothesis based on a previsualization of the data and actually, my experience during the time I have lived in Barcelona. This hypothesis are all related to the socioeconomic data and are the next:

 <br>

-  ###### The disposable income between the wealthiest and poorest districts has been reduced during the last years

 <br>

- ###### The districts with the highest m2 price are the ones with the lowest population density

 <br>

- ###### The migration between the districts in Barcelona follows a poor -> wealthy direction

 <br>

- ###### The birth rate is higher in the wealthiest districts and the mortality rate is higher in the poorest districts

 <br>

- ###### The neighbourhoods with higher disposable income are the ones with the best public transportation network

<br>




### Disposable income evolution on the different districts 2015 - 2019

<br>

Here we can see the evolution of the Disposable Income from the different districts in Barcelona for the period 2015 -2019. Here we will test our first hypothesis

___The disposable income between the wealthiest and poorest districts has been reduced during the last years___

<br>

__Added to the data explained above, here we can see the poverty risk rate; it is clear that the pooriest districts are the ones with the highest risk__

<br>

#### ___From the study explained above, we can confirm that the gap has not been reduce on the last years. It has actually been increased___

<br>

### Price evolution on the different Barcelona districts

<br>

#### Hypothesis number 2

____The districts with the highest m2 price are the ones with the lowest population density___

<br>

<br>

#### Density rate evolution for the different city neighborhoods

<br>

#### ___As we have seen on the maps above, it is true that the districts with the highest disposable income have low population density, but this is not directly related, as others with low density are found within the poorest___

<hr>
<br>
<br>

### Barcelona districts with the emigration total to other city areas
<br>

#### Hypothesis number 3

___The migration between the districts in Barcelona follows a poor -> wealthy direction___

<br>

##### Emigration

<br>

##### Inmigration

![Alt text](Data/Pictures/Sankey%20chart.png)

<br>

#### ___As we have seen on the maps above, some of the districts with highest and lowest disposable income do not have a high emigration or inmigration rate___

<hr>
<br>
<br>

### Birth rate by districts 2016-2022

<br>

#### Hypothesis number 4

___The birth rate is higher in the wealthiest districts and the mortality rate is higher in the poorest districts___

<br>

<br>
<br>

### Mortality by districts 2016-2020

![Alt text](Data/Pictures/Death%20rate.png)

#### ___After studing the data explained above we can confirm that the birth/death rate and the disposable income of the districts is not necessarily correlated___

<br>
<br>


### Public transportation system in Barcelona

#### Hypothesis number 5

___The neighbourhoods with higher disposable income are the ones with the best public transportation network___


![Alt text](Data/Gifs/Transportation%20system.gif)

#### ___Based on the map above, we can see that Barcelona is well covered by an extensive and complete transportation network. The only area that we could say that is not fully covered, in this case by the Metro network is the area located between Pedralbes and Sarria-Sant Gervasi, which is the wealthiest one. So according to this, we can refuse this hypothesis as well___
